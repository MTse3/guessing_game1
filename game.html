      <p>This program generates a prediction for the number of wins the Seattle Mariners will have this year. Your goal is to match the amount it generates.
      </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Input the number of attempts you think it will take for you to match the predictor</li>
          <li>Input your guess for the number of wins. It will inform you if you need to guess higher or lower</li>
          <li>Continue guessing until correct or you run out of tries </li>
        </ol>
      <p>When you match the predictor number it will give a congratulatory message and tell you in how many attempts it took.
