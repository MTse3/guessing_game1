This program asks the user to match the predicted number of wins the Mariners will have and how many tries they think they'll be able to guess it in
The program will supply prediction with a random number between 1 and 162.
The game will prompt the user to keep guessing until correct or they have ran out of tries. Then it will give them input whether their guess is too high or too low.
When the user matches the predictor's number it will give them a congratulatory message and tell them how many guesses they took.
Number of guesses was kept track via a variable named 'counter'.
